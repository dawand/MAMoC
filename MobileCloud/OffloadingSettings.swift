 The shortest time in seconds that FogMachine should wait before re-processing other nodes work.

Unless strict is set to true, Fog Machine will wait a bit longer to start reprocessing work based on the performance of the nodes in the network.

 - parameter strict: if true, the time provided as the first argument will be the exact time that re-processing the other nodes work begins.
